      <h1>DOs</h1>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <tt>
      <li><b>PASSPORTS PASSPORTS PASSPORTS.</b> Make sure your passport is valid for 6 months after the date you intend to leave the country. You will need to have at least 2 blank pages for every country you intend to travel to.</li>
      <li><b>VISAS.</b> Check this <a href="www.projectvisa.com/regions/Africa"<website</a> for details</li>
      <li><b>CLOTHES.</b> A lot of people don't realise how cold it gets in the evenings. You will most likely spend a lot of time outdoors so take some warm clothes as well. One word. LAYERS.</li>
      <li><b>SUNCREAM.</b> Typically a difficult one to find when you're there, so take some with you.</li>
      <li><b>TORCH.</b> Power cuts are quite frequent.</li>
      <li><b>LIP BALM.</b> An essential to protect against the dry African air, the wind in your face and the insane amount of dust during dry season.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>DONTs</h1>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>BE A CREATURE OF HABIT. Try as many local cuisines as you can.</li>
      <li>BE CARELESS WITH YOUR BELONGINGS. Awareness please.</li>
      <li>DRIVING. Don't drive around with your doors unlocked and your windows down</li>
      <li>WANDERING AROUND. Fine to do, just not in unknown areas. Stick to areas you know are safe</li>
      <li>CUT YOUR TRIP TOO SHORT. You could spend months exploring and barely scratch the surface</li>
    </ul>
