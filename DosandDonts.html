            <li><b>PASSPORTS PASSPORTS PASSPORTS.</b> Make sure your passport is valid for 6 months after the date you intend to leave the country. You will need to have at least 2 blank pages for every country you intend to travel to.</li>
            <li><b>VISAS.</b> Click <a href="https://www.projectvisa.com/"target="blank">here</a> for details</li>
              <li><b>CLOTHES.</b> A lot of people don't realise how cold it gets in the evenings. You will most likely spend a lot of time outdoors so take some warm clothes as well. One word. LAYERS.</li>
              <li><b>SUNCREAM.</b> Typically a difficult one to find when you're there, so take some with you.</li>
              <li><b>TORCH.</b> Power cuts are quite frequent.</li>
              <li><b>LIP BALM.</b> An essential to protect against the dry African air, the wind in your face and the insane amount of dust during dry season.</li>
